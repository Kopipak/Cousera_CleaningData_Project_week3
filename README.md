Cousera_CleaningData_Project_week3
==================================

This code create a tidy data set by following steps.
- 1. Import datasets from working directory
- 2. Merge the training set, the test set, subject and activity into one dataset called "dataALL"
- 3. Name variables using "features.txt" data
- 4. Extract the measurements on the mean and standard diviation
- 5. Name activiy categories with "activity_labels.txt"
- 6. Create "tidydataset" by grouping data set by subject and activity, then calculate the average of each of the variables

-----------------------------------

The data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
The experimental details are available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The data source for this code is:

------------------------------------

This .zip file includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
